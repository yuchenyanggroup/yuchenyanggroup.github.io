### RESEARCH INTERESTS

The focus of my research is on the development of statistical methods for single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) and chromatin interaction (Hi-C) data analysis, and their application to the genetic dissection of complex diseases and traits. In particular, I have developed single-cell aggregated clustering methods (implemented in software SAFE-clustering and SAME-clustering) for flexible, accurate and robust clustering scRNA-seq data. In addition, I also work on batch effect correction for single-cell RNA-seq data, which takes advantages of cell type/cluster information to guide supervised mutual nearest neighbor detection (SMNN method). More recently, I worked on the statistical framework for Hi-C peak calling (MUNIn program), and identifying and characterizing cardiovascular cell types in mouse and the wounding-related cell dynamics in zebrafish.

### ACADEMIC ENVIRONMENT

The Yang Group is located in the School of Ecology at Shenzhen Campus. Our group covers a full spectrum of research in the plant adaptation area from study design, data collection, analysis, and subsequent wet-lab follow-up. We are pround of that we offer a great and relaxed research environment (great location, graduate programs, computing facilities, etc.). We welcome new members from a wide range of disciplines to join in our group.

Our group has been actively participating in a number of collaborative researches, both internally at SYSU and externally. Our collaboraters, such as Drs. Suhua Shi, Renchao Zhou, Hao Chen, Yuan Zou and Ying Pan, are experts in plant metabolism and environmental response. There are also numerous bright graduate/undergraduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and research scientists in the vicinity whom we enjoy working with on a daily basis.
