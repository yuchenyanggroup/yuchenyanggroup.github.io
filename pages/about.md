### RESEARCH INTERESTS

The focus of my recent research is in developing innovative approaches to investigate the mechanisms underlying plant metabolism and environmental adaptation. Our goal is to understand the molecular basis of plant’s response to environmental stress (salt, heat, pollutes, etc.) and apply this knowledge to improve efficiency and ecological applicability of feature plants in ecosystem protection and environment repair. To achieve these goals, we utilize multi-omic technologies (RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, etc.) to discover the fundamental events and the basic mechanisms underlying the progression of various plant metabolisms and stress responses, such as plant hormone-mediated physiological and biochemical process, uptakes and efflux of heavy metal ions and so on. In addition, I also work on identifying and characterizing the genetic basis of plant’s circadian events, such as light and tide oscillations.
